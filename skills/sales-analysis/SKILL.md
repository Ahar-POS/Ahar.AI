# Sales Analysis Skill

Comprehensive sales and profit analysis for restaurant performance insights.

## When to use

**Sales queries:**
- "How was my sales in November compared to December?"
- "Which item sold the most in December?"
- "Show me top 10 selling items last week"
- "What's my total revenue for November?"
- "Compare sales volume Nov vs Dec"
- "How many sandwiches did I sell yesterday?"
- "What are my best selling items this month?"

**Profit queries:**
- "Which are my top profitable items for last 2 weeks?"
- "Where am I losing money most in my sandwiches?"
- "What's my best margin item?"
- "Show items with low profit margins"
- "How has Chicken Tikka Sandwich profit changed?"
- "Which ingredient has cost me the most last week?"

**Combined analysis:**
- "Show top selling items with their profit margins"
- "Which high-volume items have low profit?"
- "Revenue and profit breakdown by category"

## How it works

**Tool-based approach** - Claude has access to multiple analysis tools:

1. **get_top_items** - Get top/bottom performers by any metric
2. **get_item_details** - Deep dive into specific item (revenue, profit, margin, COGS, trends)
3. **get_ingredient_costs** - Ingredient-level cost breakdown and trends
4. **compare_periods** - Compare metrics across time periods
5. **identify_losses** - Find loss sources (low margins, waste, pricing issues)

Claude intelligently:
- Calls appropriate tools based on user query
- Decides which metrics to show (revenue, profit, margin, volume, trends)
- Chooses presentation format (tables, lists, summaries)
- Provides overview first, goes deeper on follow-up questions

## Month-Based Queries

Intelligently handles calendar month comparisons:

**Supported patterns:**
- "sales in November" → Nov 1-30 of current year
- "compare Nov and Dec" → Two-period comparison
- "November 2025" → Specific year
- "revenue in Dec vs Jan" → Cross-year comparison

**Implementation:**
- Month names parsed locally (no LLM cost)
- Date boundaries calculated automatically
- Defaults to current year unless specified
- Works with both full names (November) and abbreviations (Nov)

## Metrics Available

**Sales Metrics** (Volume & Revenue):
- **volume**: Quantity sold (for "which sold most" queries)
- **revenue**: Total sales value (for "highest revenue" queries)
- **avg_order_value**: Average transaction value

**Profit Metrics** (Profitability):
- **profit**: Absolute profit (revenue - COGS)
- **margin**: Profit margin percentage
- **COGS**: Cost of goods sold breakdown

**Item-level Metrics:**
- Total revenue (sales value)
- Total profit (revenue - COGS)
- Profit margin % ((profit / revenue) × 100)
- Sales volume (quantity sold)
- Average order value
- COGS per serving
- Contribution margin
- Trend (growing/declining/stable with %)

**Ingredient-level:**
- Total cost (across all dishes using it)
- Cost per unit
- Cost trend over time
- Usage volume
- Dishes using this ingredient
- Waste amount (if tracked)

**Category-level:**
- Aggregated metrics for groups (sandwiches, beverages, etc.)
- Category contribution to total profit
- Best/worst items in category

## Data Sources

### Collections Used

1. **orders** - Order data with line items
   - order_date, total_amount, status, items[]

2. **order_line_items** (embedded in orders)
   - menu_item_id, quantity, price_snapshot, name_snapshot

3. **menu_items** - Menu catalog
   - name, category, price, tags

4. **recipe_bom** - Recipe Bill of Materials
   - menu_item_id, ingredients[] (material_id, quantity)

5. **raw_material_inventory** - Ingredient costs
   - material_id, material_name, unit_cost_inr, category

6. **packaging_bom** - Packaging per item
   - menu_item_id, packaging items

7. **packaging_materials** - Packaging costs
   - packaging_id, unit_cost_inr

8. **stock_movement_log** - Waste tracking
   - material_id, quantity, movement_type (WASTE, STAFF_MEAL, etc.)

## Cost Calculation

**Item COGS** = Raw Material Cost + Packaging Cost

**Raw Material Cost** (per serving):
```
For each ingredient in recipe_bom:
  cost += ingredient.quantity × raw_material_inventory.unit_cost_inr
```

**Packaging Cost** (per serving):
```
For each packaging in packaging_bom:
  cost += packaging_materials.unit_cost_inr
```

**Total COGS** (for period) = COGS per serving × quantity sold

**Profit** = Revenue - Total COGS

**Margin %** = (Profit / Revenue) × 100

## Intelligent Presentation

Based on user query, Claude decides:

**"Top items last 2 weeks"**
→ Table format with revenue, profit, margin, volume

**"Why is profit down on Chicken Tikka?"**
→ Item deep dive: COGS breakdown by ingredient, margin trend, pricing analysis

**"Where am I losing money in sandwiches?"**
→ Overview: low margin items, high cost ingredients, waste
→ On follow-up: Drill into specific problem

**"Compare last month vs this month"**
→ Period comparison table with % changes and trends

## Time Period Parsing

Supports natural language:
- "last week" → 7 days ago to yesterday
- "last 2 weeks" → 14 days ago to yesterday
- "last month" → Previous calendar month
- "this month" → Current month to today
- "last quarter" → Previous 3 months
- "January" → 2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31
- "last 4 months" → 4 months ago to yesterday
- Custom: "2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31"

## Loss Analysis Depth

**First query: Overview**
```
Problems detected in Sandwiches:
1. Chicken Tikka Sandwich: -5% margin (below target 25%)
   → High chicken breast cost (₹45/serving)
2. Veg Club Sandwich: Declining sales (-30% vs last month)
   → Pricing vs competitors?
3. Paneer Sandwich: High waste (12% of ingredient)
   → Portion control issue
```

**Follow-up: Deeper dive**
```
User: "Tell me more about Chicken Tikka margin issue"

→ Deep analysis:
- Chicken breast cost: ₹45/serving (was ₹38 last month)
- Total COGS: ₹52/serving
- Selling price: ₹65
- Profit: ₹13 (20% margin, target: 25%)
- Recommendations:
  1. Increase price to ₹72 for 25% margin
  2. Reduce chicken quantity by 15g (saves ₹5)
  3. Negotiate better chicken prices
```

## Ingredient Cost Tracking

**Weekly ingredient cost changes** are automatically calculated:

Tool: `get_ingredient_costs` can show:
- Current unit cost
- Cost 1 week ago
- Cost 1 month ago
- % change
- Total spend on ingredient
- Trend (rising/falling/stable)

This data is used in P&L calculations to show true cost changes over time.

## Important Notes

- All monetary values in paise (convert to rupees for display: `/100`)
- Only include completed orders (status != 'cancelled')
- COGS includes both raw materials AND packaging
- Margin targets: Premium items >25%, Economy items >15%
- Compare same periods (7d vs 7d, not 7d vs 30d)
- Waste tracked via stock_movement_log (movement_type = 'WASTE')

## Token Optimization

This skill uses **native tool calling** (not Skills API):
- Claude decides which tools to call based on query
- No data sent until tools are invoked
- Only relevant data fetched from DB
- Results presented directly in chat (no file generation)
- Follow-up questions use conversation context (minimal tokens)

```

### Example 4: Trend Comparison
```
User: "How has Chicken Tikka Sandwich changed in last 4 months?"

Claude calls:
- get_item_details(item_name="Chicken Tikka Sandwich", period="120d")
- compare_periods(item_name="Chicken Tikka Sandwich", period1="30d", period2="90d-120d")

Response:
Chicken Tikka Sandwich Performance Trend:

Last Month vs 3 Months Ago:
┌──────────────┬────────────┬───────────────┬─────────┐
│ Metric       │ Last 30d   │ 3 Months Ago  │ Change  │
├──────────────┼────────────┼───────────────┼─────────┤
│ Revenue      │ ₹22,450    │ ₹28,600       │  -21.5% │
│ Volume       │    142     │     186       │  -23.7% │
│ Profit       │ ₹9,200     │ ₹13,850       │  -33.6% │
│ Margin       │   41.0%    │    48.4%      │   -7.4% │
│ COGS/serving │    ₹52     │     ₹45       │  +15.6% │
└──────────────┴────────────┴───────────────┴─────────┘

📉 Trend: DECLINING

Root Causes:
1. Sales volume down 24% - demand issue or competition?
2. COGS increased 16% - ingredient cost inflation
3. Margin compressed from 48% to 41%

Recommendations:
1. Price increase from ₹65 to ₹72 (+10%)
2. Investigate volume decline (promotion ended?)
3. Review chicken breast supplier pricing
```

## Integration with P&L

Ingredient cost data from this skill feeds into:
- P&L Statement generation (COGS section)
- Cost variance analysis
- Budget vs actual tracking

When user asks "generate P&L", it uses latest ingredient costs from raw_material_inventory which are tracked weekly via this skill.

## Error Handling

**No data for period:**
```
"No orders found for [period]. Please verify date range or try a different period."
```

**Item not found:**
```
"Item '[name]' not found. Did you mean: [suggestions]?"
```

**Missing COGS data:**
```
"COGS data unavailable for [item]. Recipe BOM or ingredient costs missing in database."
```
