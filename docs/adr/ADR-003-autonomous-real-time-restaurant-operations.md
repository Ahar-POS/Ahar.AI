# ADR-003: Autonomous Real-Time Restaurant Operations

**Date**: 2026-04-14  
**Status**: Accepted (Phase 1, 3, 4 verified; Phase 2 data-blocked; Phase 5 ongoing; v7 forecaster integrated; Operations Pulse Service live; alert routing overhauled; Customer Experience Agent added)  
**Decider**: Pandiarajan  
**Context**: Backend orchestration, event-driven agent architecture, approval workflows, notifications

---

## Problem

The existing system had autonomous agents (Inventory, Financial, Strategic) running on fixed cron schedules with a fully-wired event bus that was never actually used — no service published events. Agents felt like batch jobs, not intelligent real-time operators. The goal was to make Ahar truly autonomous:

- React to what is happening *now* (stock crossing reorder mid-service, perishables about to expire, revenue falling behind pace)
- Auto-execute low-risk actions; route high-risk actions to manager approval
- Route alerts to the right role (manager, chef, store keeper)
- Suggest "Today's Special" from expiring ingredients before waste occurs

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Event Bus activation — publish low_stock from inventory_service

- **Chosen**: `inventory_service.py` now publishes `inventory.low_stock` from three call sites: `update_item` (manual stock patch), `consume_for_order` (negative stock), and post-decrement reorder check. Publishing is fire-and-forget using `asyncio.create_task(coro)` to avoid blocking the sync caller.
- **Rejected**: Polling inventory on a schedule to detect crossings — too slow for mid-service reactions (order consumption can tip stock instantly).
- **Reason**: The event bus was already wired but unused. Activating it at the correct write path gives sub-second reaction time from stock edit to shopping list creation.

**Bug fixed during implementation**: `_publish_low_stock_event` is a sync method but `EventBus.publish` is async. Original code called `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` which fails in a running async loop. Fixed by wrapping in `asyncio.create_task(coro)`.

---

### Decision: Orchestrator as central hub subscribing to events

- **Chosen**: `OrchestratorService` subscribes to four events on startup: `inventory.low_stock`, `inventory.expiring_soon`, `revenue.anomaly`, `kitchen.bottleneck`. Each handler creates a notification and triggers the relevant agent.
- **Rejected**: Having each agent subscribe directly — would scatter subscription management and make it hard to add cross-cutting concerns (notification creation, audit logging).
- **Reason**: Centralising all event-to-action wiring in the orchestrator gives a single place to trace the full reactive flow.

**MongoDB index conflict fixed**: `recipe_bom.menu_item_id` had a non-unique index from a prior migration; orchestrator tried to create a unique one with the same name → `IndexKeySpecsConflict`. Fixed with drop-and-recreate pattern in `__init__`.

---

### Decision: Scheduled jobs added to Orchestrator

- **Chosen**: Two new APScheduler cron jobs registered alongside existing ones:
  - `revenue_monitor_hourly` — every hour at `:05` → `_run_revenue_monitor()`
  - `expiry_monitor_daily` — 7:00 AM IST → `_run_expiry_monitor()`
- **Rejected**: Separate microservices for each monitor — premature infrastructure complexity for a single-restaurant system.
- **Reason**: APScheduler is already embedded in the orchestrator. Adding jobs costs zero new infrastructure.

| Job | Schedule | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `inventory_daily` | 6:00 AM | Run inventory agent |
| `financial_daily` | 11:00 PM | Run financial agent |
| `forecast_weekly` | Sunday 00:00 | Run demand forecaster |
| `revenue_monitor_hourly` | :05 every hour | Check for revenue anomaly |
| `expiry_monitor_daily` | 7:00 AM | Generate Today's Special |

---

### Decision: Revenue Monitor — same-hour, same-weekday historical comparison

- **Chosen**: Compare current-hour revenue against the 30-day historical average for the **same hour and same weekday**. Requires `REVENUE_ANOMALY_MIN_HISTORY_DAYS=7` matching days before firing. Threshold: fire if `current / avg < 0.60`. Severity: "high" if ratio < 0.40, else "medium".
- **Rejected**: Simple daily total comparison — masks intra-day patterns (lunch peak vs dead 3 PM hour would both look the same as "low revenue").
- **Reason**: Same-weekday comparison removes Monday-vs-Saturday distortion. Same-hour comparison catches real-time drops before the shift ends.

**Config knobs added** (`config.py`):
- `REVENUE_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD: float = 0.60`
- `REVENUE_ANOMALY_MIN_HISTORY_DAYS: int = 7`

---

### Decision: Expiry Monitor — LLM-generated "Today's Special" pending approval

- **Chosen**: Daily at 7 AM, query perishable items with `expiry_date` within 2 days. Build a prompt listing ingredients + stock + expiry date. Call Claude (`AGENT_MODEL_DEFAULT = claude-sonnet-4-5`) with max_tokens=512 to generate a dish suggestion. Write to `expiry_specials` collection with `status: "pending"`. Manager approves/rejects via `POST /api/v1/approvals/expiry-specials/{id}/approve`.
- **Rejected**: Auto-posting the special to the menu — too high risk without human review. Chefs may not have the skill or equipment to execute the suggested dish.
- **Reason**: Human-in-the-loop preserves kitchen control while eliminating the cognitive burden of "what do I do with this expiring chicken?".

**Fallback**: If `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is unset, returns a generic placeholder suggestion rather than crashing.

---

### Decision: In-app notification system (MongoDB-backed, role-targeted)

- **Chosen**: New `notifications` collection with TTL of 7 days. Each notification carries `target_roles: [str]` so GET filters by caller's role. Four types: `low_stock`, `revenue_anomaly`, `expiry_alert`, `po_approval`. `_create_notification()` is best-effort (never raises) in the orchestrator.
- **Rejected**: Push notifications (FCM/APNs) — over-engineered for an internal restaurant tool. Email — already rejected in plan (operators want in-app only).
- **Reason**: MongoDB-backed poll model is the simplest implementation that survives page refresh and doesn't require a websocket server.

**API endpoints added** (`/api/v1/notifications`):
- `GET /notifications` — paginated, role-filtered, optional `unread_only`
- `GET /notifications/unread-count` — badge count
- `PUT /notifications/{id}/read` — mark single read
- `PUT /notifications/mark-all-read` — bulk mark read

---

### Decision: Smart auto-approval with 4 gates

- **Chosen**: `_requires_approval()` checks four sequential gates. If all pass → auto-approve with `reviewed_by: "orchestrator_auto"`. If any fail → `status: "pending"` for manager review.

| Gate | Condition for auto-approval |
|---|---|
| Cost | Total order cost < `AUTO_APPROVE_LIMIT_INR` (rupees) |
| Supplier | All items have a known (non-empty) `supplier_name` |
| Quantity | Each item's `quantity_to_order ≤ 2 × reorder_qty` |
| Expiry discount | No item has `expiry_discount: True` flag |

- **Rejected**: Single cost threshold only — misses cases like unknown suppliers or unusually large orders that warrant human review even if cheap.
- **Reason**: Four gates cover the main risk dimensions. The quantity gate (2× reorder_qty) catches demand-spike miscalculations. The expiry gate prevents auto-purchasing items that are about to be wasted.

**Config knob**: `AUTO_APPROVE_LIMIT_INR: int = 5000` (set to `500000` = ₹5 lakh in `.env` during testing).

---

### Decision: Per-item approval (Option B) for shopping lists

- **Chosen**: `POST /api/v1/approvals/purchase-orders/{id}/review` accepts a list of `{material_id, action, quantity, reason}`. Items can be individually approved or rejected in a single call. Status transitions: `pending` → `partially_approved` (some decided, some still pending) → `approved` or `rejected` (all decided).
- **Rejected**: Option A (approve/reject whole list) as the only mechanism — manager may want to approve 8 of 10 items and reject 2 overpriced ones.
- **Reason**: Partial submissions are valid; undecided items stay pending, allowing incremental review across shifts.

---

### Decision: Manual trigger endpoint for all agents/monitors

- **Chosen**: `POST /api/v1/health/trigger-agent/{agent_name}` extended to accept `expiry` and `revenue` in addition to existing `inventory`, `financial`, `forecaster`. No auth required (health endpoint).
- **Rejected**: Waiting for cron during testing — 7 AM cron makes expiry monitor untestable in a normal work session.
- **Reason**: Developer ergonomics. Without a manual trigger, testing Phase 2 and 3 requires either waiting for the scheduler or mocking time.

---

### Decision: v7 visibility and eligibility fix post-integration

- **Chosen**: After initial v7 integration, commit `fix: enable v7 forecasting visibility and eligibility` (f08165d) corrected two issues: (1) forecast results were not surfaced in the UI response shape expected by the frontend; (2) eligibility check edge cases caused some Class A items to incorrectly fall through to Prophet. Both fixed without changing the core v7 → Prophet → rolling mean fallback chain.
- **Reason**: Integration testing revealed the API response didn't include the `forecast_model` field the frontend expected, and the `can_use_v7()` guard had an off-by-one on the history window boundary.

---

### Decision: Integrate v7 Hybrid ABC model as primary forecaster in inventory agent

- **Chosen**: `DemandForecaster.forecast_menu_item()` now routes through `HybridABCForecaster` (v7) before falling back to Prophet. Fallback chain: **v7 → Prophet → rolling mean**. v7 is bypassed when `as_of_date` is set (backtesting path — v7 was trained on data up to 2026-02-28).
- **Rejected**: Keeping Prophet as primary — Prophet's `stan_backend` is broken in the current environment and v7 has materially better R² for Class A items (0.953 vs Prophet's uncalibrated output).
- **Reason**: v7 artifacts exist and are stable. The production fallback chain ensures zero regression — any item v7 can't handle (new item, insufficient history) silently falls back to Prophet.

**Key implementation decisions during integration**:

1. **Name-map keying by `_id`, not `menu_item_id`**: `orders.items.menu_item_id` and `recipe_bom.menu_item_id` store MongoDB `ObjectId` hex strings. `menu_items.menu_item_id` is a separate MENU001-style field. `load_name_map()` was corrected to key by `str(doc["_id"])`.

2. **Lookback window extended from 90 → 180 days**: Class B recipe items only had orders in Dec 2025. A 90-day lookback from April 2026 found no history; v7 eligibility failed with `insufficient_history`. Extending to 180 days captures Dec 2025 data.

3. **Manual trigger bypasses forecast cache**: `POST /api/v1/health/trigger-agent/inventory` now sets `forecast_use_cache=False` so developers can see live v7 predictions immediately without waiting for cache expiry. Scheduled runs keep cache enabled.

4. **`forecast_model` field added to agent tool output**: The simplified demand dict now includes `"forecast_model": f.get("model_type", "unknown")`. The agent system prompt was updated to guide Claude on safety-stock adjustments per model tier:
   - `hybrid_abc_v7_A` (R²≈0.95): trust quantity, standard buffer
   - `hybrid_abc_v7_B` (R²≈0.26): standard buffer
   - `hybrid_abc_v7_C` (R²≈0.30): +30% safety buffer
   - `prophet`: standard buffer
   - `fallback`: +40% safety buffer, conservative quantities

5. **Logging configuration in `main.py`**: Uvicorn's log config was not guaranteeing that application loggers had a StreamHandler at startup. Root logger level and handler explicitly set so v7 inference logs (`v7 [hybrid_abc_v7_A] used for ...`) reliably appear in the terminal.

6. **`_execution_context` stored on base agent**: `BaseAgent.execute()` now stores `self._execution_context = context` so tool methods can read run-level flags like `forecast_use_cache` without passing them through every call chain.

**Confirmed production results (2026-04-14)**:
- 323 items in v7 ABC map loaded at first forecast call
- 365 of 444 DB menu items matched to v7 training set by canonical name
- Recipe BOM eligible items: A=57, B=3, C=0
- `v7 [hybrid_abc_v7_A] used for <id>` log lines confirmed for all Class A recipe items
- Prophet fallback confirmed for the 79 unmatched items

### Decision: Operations Pulse Service — 7 health checks on a 30-minute heartbeat (2026-05-02)

- **Chosen**: New `OperationsPulseService` runs 7 targeted checks every 30 minutes via an APScheduler job and publishes results to `financial_alerts`. Checks: (1) revenue pace vs historical average, (2) per-channel dip detection, (3) kitchen throughput / prep-time outliers, (4) order cancellation rate, (5) average order value anomaly, (6) table stale (occupied but no activity for > N minutes), (7) dead period (zero orders during expected operating hours).
- **Rejected**: Expanding the existing `revenue_monitor_service` with more checks — the revenue monitor's logic is hourly and same-weekday focused; tacking on 6 unrelated checks would violate single-responsibility.
- **Reason**: A dedicated pulse service with a fixed 30-min cadence gives the owner a predictable health-check rhythm. Each check is independently configurable. The single `pulse_completed` heartbeat (see below) prevents notification flood.

**New APScheduler job added to Orchestrator**:

| Job | Schedule | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `operations_pulse` | Every 30 min | Run all 7 pulse checks; publish one `pulse_completed` event |

**`OrderChannel` enum and `OperatingHours` model** added to `RestaurantSettings` so the dead-period and channel-dip checks know which hours and channels are expected to be active.

---

### Decision: Alert routing overhaul — all pulse results to `financial_alerts` + single heartbeat notification (2026-05-03)

- **Chosen**: All 7 pulse-check handlers write results into the `financial_alerts` collection only. No per-alert `notifications` document is created. After all 7 checks complete, the orchestrator fires a single `pulse_completed` notification (type: `operations_pulse`) with a summary count. The dashboard service reads `financial_alerts` directly to build Action Queue cards.
- **Rejected**: Continuing the previous pattern of writing one `notifications` row per alert — with 7 checks running every 30 minutes, this produced up to 7 × 48 = 336 notifications per day, flooding the bell badge with non-actionable items.
- **Reason**: Separating "background health data" (financial_alerts) from "things requiring human attention" (notifications bell) keeps the bell meaningful. The single heartbeat tells the owner "a pulse ran" without enumerating every finding.

**Channel dip consolidation**: Previously, each dipping channel fired a separate event. Now the pulse service collects all channels that are below threshold in a single run and emits one `channel_dip` event with a `channels: []` array. This prevents the Action Queue from showing 4 separate "Swiggy dip / Zomato dip / ..." cards.

**Revenue anomaly dedup**: Before inserting a new revenue-anomaly alert, the service resolves (closes) all same-restaurant active alerts of that type. This prevents a dismissed card from reappearing on the next pulse run.

---

### Decision: Customer Experience Agent — daily promotion suggestions with human approval (2026-05-02)

- **Chosen**: New `CustomerExperienceAgent` runs daily at 7:30 AM. It ingests sales trends, item co-occurrence patterns, demand spikes, and expiring inventory to generate 2–4 promotion suggestions. Each suggestion carries a type (`PERCENTAGE_OFF`, `COMBO_DEAL`, `EXPIRY_CLEAR`, `SPIKE_LEVERAGE`), target items, discount value, and a reasoning string. Suggestions are persisted with `status: "pending"` and surfaced to the owner for approval in the Action Queue. On approval, the promotion is inserted into a `promotions` collection. POS discount fields (`discount_paise`, `applied_promo_id`, `original_price_snapshot`) are added to `OrderItem` so active promos are tracked per order line.
- **Rejected**: Auto-applying promotions without owner approval — discounts directly affect revenue and require owner judgement on margin impact.
- **Rejected**: Manual-only promotion creation — the agent's signal (co-occurrence, demand spike) surfaces non-obvious opportunities the owner wouldn't find by inspection.
- **Reason**: Human-in-the-loop for promotion approval mirrors the same pattern used for inventory shopping lists and expiry specials. The agent is a signal generator; the owner is the decision maker. Waiters see active promotions with visual indicators on the order screen so they can proactively up-sell.

**New endpoints added**:
- `GET /api/v1/promotions/active` — active promotions for the POS order screen
- `POST /api/v1/approvals/promotions/{id}/approve` — owner approves, inserts into `promotions`
- `POST /api/v1/approvals/promotions/{id}/reject` — owner rejects, closes suggestion

**Manual trigger**: Intelligence Hub now shows a "Run Customer Experience Agent" button (`POST /api/v1/health/trigger-agent/customer_experience`).

---

## Decisions Rejected / Deferred

### Rejected: Push notifications (FCM/APNs, email)
- **Reason**: Internal tool used by staff on-premises. MongoDB poll is sufficient; push infrastructure adds complexity and cost.

### Rejected: Fully automated shopping list execution (no approval step)
- **Reason**: Supplier orders involve real money. Even auto-approved lists are logged with `reviewed_by: "orchestrator_auto"` for audit purposes — a human can always reverse.

### Partially Implemented: Frontend notification bell UI
- **Original status**: Deferred — backend API complete, frontend integration pending.
- **Update (2026-04-14)**: `AppNavBar.tsx` modified to include notification bell. `frontend/src/services/notifications.ts` created as the API client. Unread count badge and Today's Special approval card in the Command Center still pending — tracked in ADR-004.

### Deferred: Revenue monitor with live data
- **Reason**: Test data (orders collection) is all historical (pre-April 2026). Revenue monitor requires 7+ days of recent same-hour/weekday data. Code is correct — will function in production once live orders flow.

### Deferred: Phase 5 quantity gate data quality
- **Reason**: `reorder_qty` values in inventory DB do not reflect real demand (e.g. Chicken Boneless has `reorder_qty=10,000g` but demand-driven order quantity is ~348,000g). The gate math is correct but fires spuriously on bad seed data. Fix: update `reorder_qty` values to reflect 7-day demand equivalents. Chicken Boneless patched to 300,000g during testing session.

---

## Known Limitations

| Issue | Impact | Path forward |
|---|---|---|
| `float("inf")` in inventory agent output | JSON serialization error when `days_until_stockout = inf` (zero demand items) | Fixed: `min(days_until_stockout, 9999.0)` |
| `reorder_qty` seed data mismatch | Quantity gate blocks auto-approval for most items | Manually patch DB; or derive `reorder_qty` from demand forecaster output |
| Revenue monitor needs live order data | Phase 2 cannot be validated in dev | Acceptable — seed orders dated today or lower `MIN_HISTORY_DAYS=1` for testing |
| Expiry monitor requires `expiry_date` field | No production inventory items have `expiry_date` populated | Seed manually in dev; add field to inventory create/edit UI |
| Shopping list `reviewed_by` field (not `approved_by`) | Naming inconsistency from earlier code | Document only — `reviewed_by: "orchestrator_auto"` is the auto-approval marker |
| Prawns (Medium) quantity gate | `ordered=29,959` vs `reorder_qty=5,000` (2×=10,000) — gate fails | Same root cause as Chicken Boneless — `reorder_qty` needs updating |

## Next Decisions Pending

1. **reorder_qty calibration strategy** — Should `reorder_qty` be a static field maintained by store keepers, or should it be auto-computed from the demand forecaster output? If auto-computed, when does it update (weekly with forecaster cron)?
2. **Frontend notification bell** — Polling interval, unread badge placement, Today's Special approval card in the Command Center screen.
3. **Expiry date UX** — How does store keeper enter `expiry_date` when receiving stock? Add field to Inventory create/edit form, or capture during OCR bill review workflow?
4. **Revenue monitor live validation** — When do we get enough live order data (7 days) to confirm the anomaly detection fires correctly end-to-end?
5. **Multi-restaurant scoping** — All new collections use `restaurant_id = "antera_jubilee_hills"` hardcoded. Define the migration path when a second restaurant onboards.
6. **v7 retraining cadence** — 79 DB items are not in the training set (added after the Feb 2026 cutoff). Define how often v7 is retrained so new menu items get proper ABC models rather than Prophet fallback.
7. **Prophet replacement** — Prophet's `stan_backend` is broken in the current Python environment. Now that v7 handles 57/60 recipe items, decide whether to repair Prophet, replace it with a lighter fallback (e.g. Exponential Smoothing), or accept the current rolling-mean ultimate fallback for Prophet-ineligible items.
